#Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)

Regression Dicontinuity(RD) : designs exploit precise knowledge of the rules determining treatment.
It is based on the idea that in a highly rule-based world, some rules are arbitrary and therefore provide good experiments. 

- RDD는 다양한 경계선을 활용하여 인과관계에 다가서는 Natural Experiment 기법이다.

# 1. Sharp RDD
ex) What if you were to run a regression of local violence on an indicator of 
whether the local elected politician was a member of such a regional party? 
Would you expect to uncover a causal effect?
  R_i = {1,0}
# 2. Fuzzy RDD
